# Course Platform "Kondensator Wiedzy" (ASP.NET Core MVC)

A web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC that allows users to browse courses, view modules, watch video modules and manage content through role‑based access. It was originally designed for online courses, but with further development it can evolve into a universal platform for any type of learning content.
